    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. To break it down, Hyper text is the ability of the text document to have links, either to various sections of the same webpage or to other text documents web pages. Markup Language refers to how the language is structured. A simple text document is marked up with tags that define the role of the text between the tags.</p>
    <p>For example, heading text like the header “W3C and HTML and CSS” seen on the top of this page is surrounded by and H2 tags. This lets your browser know that the text is a heading, and the number indicates the prominence/importance of the heading (with 2 being the second most important). Tags let the web browser know what the text between the tags is for and, originally, how the browser should display the text. HTML is a pretty basic and HTML only web pages reflect this.</p>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This tells browsers how to display HTML tags. These style rules override the default display rules that browsers have for HTML tags. The style sheets are cascading in that there can be a number of conflicting rules that can be applied to a particular tag but the most specifically targeted rules will override less specifically targeted rules. In short, CSS saves web designers time and also speeds up web pages by decreasing the amount of data needed.</p>
    <p>W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium. For the world wide web, it is the main international standards body. Both HTML and CSS are standards under W3C with the addition of many others. The organization was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee. The W3C develops standards and also tries to foster compatibility and agreement on the standards by members of the industry. The HTML standard can have several difference flavors which may not be compatible. W3C works to define what HTML is and also encourages players in the web industry to adopt the defined standard. If the W3C governed playing cards for example, they would document and define that there are 52 cards in a deck, 4 kings, what a king card should look like, the size of the cards, etc..</p>
